This is the third installment of my project on mapping inference to physics. The previous parts looked at how we can map statistical inference of continuous variables to electrodyanmics ([part 1](https://jsbryaniv.github.io/information-physics-part-one/)) and how we can set up the general inference problem as a system of correlated binary random variables ([part 2](https://jsbryaniv.github.io/mapping-inference-to-physics/)). In this third part we show that we can map the correlation between continuous variables and binary variables to a quantum mechanics.

You can check out the latest version of the manuscript here: [Information Physics](https://jsbryaniv.github.io/files/Info_Physics_part3.pdf). Keep in mind that this is still a work in progress, so there may be typos, errors, and I clearly havent put in enough citations yet. But I hope that most readers will be able to ignore these and focus on the big picture. Please feel free to leave comments and suggestions, your feedback is greatly appreciated!

In the next, and hopefully final part, I will show how we can use these findings to make an optimzed AI inference algorithm based on mapping variables to physical quantities. Stay tuned!
