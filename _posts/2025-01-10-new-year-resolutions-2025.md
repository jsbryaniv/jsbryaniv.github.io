New Year, New Resolutions! I have high hopes for 2025, so to keep myself accountable, I want to make my resolutions public. If any of you catch me slacking, feel free to call me out. I encourage it!

I’m especially excited about this new year because it coincides with the start of my new position as an AI Research Fellow at Mayo Clinic Phoenix. So my resolutions this year are largely career focussed. In particular I want to focus on building up my online presence and personal brand.

Last year I started experimenting with LinkedIn and X to share my experiences with physics, AI, healthcare, and entrepreneurship. What I learned is that a little went a long way. I originally started my [personal website](https://jsbryaniv.github.io/) as a project portfolio, not really expecting many people to read it. To my surprise I learned that many people out there actually are reading what I say and enjoying it. So thank you for that, it really means a lot!

Beyond that, I discovered that posting semi-regularly on LinkedIn with opinions and tutorials helped position me as an expert in my field. I have had several people reach out to me for advice, project opportunities, and even a consulting gig.

A little bit of posting went a long way, so this year I want to ramp up my posting in 2025 to see how far it takes me. In particular, I want to start posting more regularly, more widely, and fostering more engagement.

Here is a concrete list of some of the goals I've made for 2025:

* Post 2 LinkedIn posts per week (I’m learning that more than that is actually bad for * the algorithm).
* Engage with other people daily via comments, M-F.
* Write at least 2 blog posts per month, one tutorial, one opinion piece.
* Start using other platforms more regularly.
* Write about something every day.

I think that the last goal about writing everyday is key. I won’t post everything I write, but I will stick to the habit. Historically it takes me a while to make thoughtful posts, and I want to become more efficient. Since practice makes perfect, my hope is that by writing everyday it will become easier as the year progresses. Also, writing is an important part of every science career, so I already write a lot. The difference is that instead of focussing on technical manuscripts I want to write things that more people will read.

My hope is that by scaling up my personal branding, I will set myself up for new successful opportunities in 2026. And again, if you catch me slacking please call me out!
